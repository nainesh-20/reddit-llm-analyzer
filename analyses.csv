While the original post asks about Safari and Chrome, many users also highlight **Firefox** as a primary alternative.

**Safari** is frequently chosen for its seamless **integration with the Apple ecosystem**, including features like Apple Pay, iCloud Keychain for passwords, autofill of one-time 2FA codes from texts, and Private Relay for enhanced privacy. Users appreciate its **efficiency, lower resource consumption, and better battery life** on MacBooks, as well as its smooth user interface. Some mention using search engines like DuckDuckGo or Kagi with Safari for additional privacy.

**Firefox** emerges as a very popular choice, often favored by users who value **privacy** and powerful **ad-blocking capabilities** (especially uBlock Origin). Many users have been loyal to Firefox for many years, appreciating its extensive selection of **extensions and developer tools**, cross-platform syncing across various operating systems, and its reputation as a non-Google browser that is less resource-intensive than Chrome.

**Chrome** receives significant criticism. Many users explicitly state they avoid it due to concerns about it being a **""resource hog""** (consuming more RAM and battery), **privacy issues** (Google's data collection, often described as ""spyware""), and recent changes that limit the effectiveness of powerful ad-blockers like uBlock Origin. However, some users still use Chrome for work purposes, especially if their workplace uses Google Workspace, or due to being deeply integrated into the Google ecosystem for personal reasons, and for its multiple profile support.

Other browsers like **Brave**, **Edge**, and **Arc** are also mentioned. Brave is chosen for its **built-in ad-blocking** and privacy features, though some criticize its optional crypto functionalities. Edge is used by those who need to sync with Windows devices or for specific work environments. Arc is highlighted for its unique user interface and productivity features like ""spaces"" and side-by-side tabs.

In summary, the discussion shows a strong preference for **Safari due to its ecosystem integration and efficiency**, and **Firefox for its privacy, ad-blocking, and extensibility**. Chrome is largely seen as undesirable due to performance and privacy concerns.",,"[[[{""author"": ""se7entythree"", ""score"": 270, ""ef_score"": 270, ""body"": ""Been a Firefox user for 20ish years"", ""depth"": 0}, null], [{""author"": ""OneOldBear"", ""score"": 213, ""ef_score"": 213, ""body"": ""Safari.
